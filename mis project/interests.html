		<p>I have always liked to play sports and do outdoor activities. I played Football and Ice Hockey in high school but I couldn't keep playing when I got to college.  I like to fish and do other things outside because I just enjoy the outdoors. I keep myself busy now with exercise and school work, but I will play various sports and go on the trails every once in a while.  </p>
