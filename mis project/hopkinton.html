		<p>Hopkinton Massachussetts is the town where I grew up. Hopkinton is a relatively small town in south Massachussetts that is only known to be the place where the boston marathon starts. We haven't been too good athletically in the time that I went to school there apart from out golf and volleyball programs which where top of the state multiple years.   </p>
